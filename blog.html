               <p title="With Tarbi"> Welcome to my Blogs<br> These are some of my thoughts</p>
               <h2>Life in Nepal</h2>
               <p> Growing up in Nepal, I was fortunate to be the second generation in my family who got formal education. I am the first generation in my family who is earning a undergraduate degree. In Nepal it has only been merely 2-3 generations of people who have received formal education. And coming from a third world country it is a long run to be here raising my voice in the future 
               and the advanced field of computer science. I believe I have a cause to fulfil and a voice to raise on behalf of myself and other first generation students like me who are able to change the world through
               education</p>
